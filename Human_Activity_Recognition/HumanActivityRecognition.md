## Human Activity Recognition
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphone sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes. HAR is a type of time series classification problem where various machine learning and deep learning models are employed to achieve optimal results. This project utilizes the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a variant of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to recognize different human activities like standing, climbing upstairs, and downstairs.

### Objective

The primary goal of this project is to recognize human activities using data from smartphone sensors. This involves leveraging the capabilities of LSTM networks to capture order dependencies in sequence prediction tasks.
